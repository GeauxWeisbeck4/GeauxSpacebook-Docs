# Eleventy: A Complete Tutorial by GeauxWeisbeck4

Hey y'all! my name is Andrew and I am the author of this documentation that is my best attempt at a complete walk through of Eleventy. Before I get started into the Nitty Gritty of things, I just want to share a few things about myself and this project.

When I found [Eleventy-dot-dev](https://11ty.dev), I was getting frustrated with myself and coding. Luckily I watched a tutorial by [Kevin Powell](https://kevinpowell.com) and I was hooked to 11ty forever! It is such a great site for so many things - especially its flexibility and ability to fit many different shoes and work for practically anyone. 

The community is one of the best you'll find  out there, they have a lot of Starter Projects, and you can even get listed on their professional site! 

This notebook is one of my favorites, especially for a small project. It is perfect to host all my 11ty tutorials and possibly my course. 

## Getting Started

I am going to go ahead and start out with some content so this might not get done for a little bit.
